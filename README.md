# GreatShop
GreatShop is an E-Commerce website that sells automotive performance parts. It is built using ASP.NET Core MVC with the intended purpose of learning .NET, the MVC architecture and C#.
I wanted to recreate the e-commerse group project we built using PHP for a Software Engineeeing course at NIU. I find that a great way for me to learn a new programing language or technology, is by re-creating a project I've previously completed. By no means is this more than an intro project, as there are endless amount of features I want to add, and improve. But, I greatly enjoy the journey of learning and applying something new.
