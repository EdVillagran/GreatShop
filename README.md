# GreatShop
GreatShop is an E-Commerce website that sells automotive performance parts. Built using ASP.NET Core MVC with the intended purpose of learning .NET, the MVC architecture and C#.
I wanted to recreate the e-commerse group project we built using PHP for CSCI470 Software Engineeeing at NIU. There is so much I've learned and so much more to learn.
As well as the endless amount of features I can add or edit.
